README FILE FOR KEYLOGGER

How does the keylogger work:
Once the program is launched, every keystroke will be recorded.
All keystrokes will be logged in file 'output.txt' in C://output.txt
To exit the program, press "ESC".
Once the program is exited, it will automatically send the log file to remote server.

NOTE:
An output.txt must first be manually created in C drive unless user has permission to read/write in C drive.
Port number and user info must be entered for the program to work.
